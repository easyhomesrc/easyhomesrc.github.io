EasyMesh Team, its affiliates and subsidiaries ("we", "us", "our", "EasyMesh") are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Statement ("Statement") describes our practices in connection with information privacy on personal data we process through your individual use of the following services, products, and related mobile applications (collectively, the "Products")

- EasyMesh App

In this Privacy Notice, "Personal Data" means information that can be used to identify an individual, either from that information alone, or from that information and other information we have access to about that individual. “Smart Devices” refers to those nonstandard computing devices produced or manufactured by hardware manufacturers, with human-machine interface and the ability to transmit data that connect wirelessly to a network, including: smart home appliances, smart wearable devices, smart air cleaning devices, etc. "Apps" refers to those mobile applications developed by EasyMesh Team that provide end users remote control to Smart Devices and with the ability to connect to EasyMesh Server.

### What Personal Data do We Collect

In order to provide our services to you, we will ask you to provide necessary Personal Data that is required to provide those services. If you do not provide your Personal Data, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services.

#### 1. Nickname (or username)

The nickname (or username) is a user-defined name, which is used as the user's ID, and is unique within the product range. The nickname can be used without the user's real name, and can be freely specified without duplication.

#### 2. Password

The user logs in to use it and saves it on the server after encryption.

#### 3. Email

The email address verifies the uniqueness of the user and protects the password of the user.

- Register the user, change the password, delete the account, and send a verification code to the email address when the new device logs in. The user uses the verification code to prove their identity.

- Changes to privacy policies, emergencies, major service changes, etc. will be emailed to users. When a user deletes his or her account, the nickname, encrypted password, and email address will be deleted from the server.

#### 4. Devices

For each gateway of the user, the system automatically generates a random number as the unique identification ID of the gateway. After the user restores the gateway to factory settings, the system will generate a new random ID.

- A list of user nicknames to which each gateway belongs is stored on the server.

- For each Zigbee device joining the gateway, the device ID number, device name, device type, online status, activation time, firmware version, and upgrade information are saved. This data is to enable users to find the original device when they log in on the new mobile device.

- When a user deletes a device, its data will be deleted from the server.

- When a user deletes a gateway, all information about this gateway is deleted from the server.

- When you use our products, we may collect information reported by your device. For example, a smart light bulb may report the on / off status, color temperature, hue, saturation, and brightness of a light.

- If the user has Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice control enabled, the above information of the Zigbee device will be passed to Google and Amazon so that the user can query and control their device on the voice device.

All the above information is stored on a server in the European Union provided by Amazon AWS.

When push information is enabled, the user's mobile phone's identification information "Push Notification Identifier" will be saved on Google's Firebase service so that users can receive push information.

Google is committed to helping our customers succeed with GDPR compliance, whether they are large software companies or independent developers. See the links below for specific information:

[Privacy and Security in Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)

When there is a service failure or a major change, a message may be pushed to the user.
